First project (2 versions) for Engeto course - Online Python Akademy.

Text Analyzer

A simple Python application for working with texts.
The user logs in with a username and password and then chooses one of three texts to analyze.

Features

- User login (username and password verification)

- Text selection (choose between 1–3)

- Cleaning text from commas and dots

- Basic statistics:

  - number of words

  - number of words starting with an uppercase letter

  - number of fully uppercase words

  - number of fully lowercase words

  - number of numeric strings and their total sum

- Simple table showing word lengths and their frequency (visualized with stars *)


Version 1 – Basic Solution

The code is written in a simple way and some parts are longer than needed.
Thats because I focused mainly on making sure the program works according to the assignment.

File: main_basic.py


Version 2 – Optimized Solution

Later, I refactored the project into a more structured form and repeating code is reduced.
The result is cleaner and easier to maintain.
